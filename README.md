# Factorio-Mod-Updater
A program for updating your Factorio mods to the latest versions. It does not download new mods or dependencies. It only updates the mods you have in your PC to the latest versions which means they only work on Factorio 2.0 or above if the developer of mods has updated to 2.0 them otherwise they may still be viable on older versions of Factorio.

To download new mods here's an easy method below. It works independently of the updater and supports old verions of Factorio.

# Downloading New Mods
For your browser of choice (Chrome, Firefox etc.), search and install "Tampermonkey" extension. Then click this [Script](https://re146.dev/factorio/mods/free-factorio-mods-downloader-en.user.js) It should bring up the install menu for Tampermonkey. Install the script and allow necessary permissions.

Now go to [Factorio Mods](https://mods.factorio.com/)    

CLICK on the mod of your choice and there should be a "Download from re146.dev" green button on the mod page. If you have a Factorio account logged in, make sure to log out otherwise the button wouldn't be functional. Clicking on download will take you to a webpage where you can download the latest or old versions of the mod.
